Welcome to the CDW developer test. Excuse us for this totally contrived Function App Project.
What we require the you to do:
1. Refactor FunctionApp project to general development best practices and best practices related to .NET core.
2. Add unit tests to test the function app.
3. For the purposes of refactoring, please assume that persistance mechanism undelying the DbContext is an external database. 
Test project uses InMemory EFCore provider to minimise dependencies. We do not require any changes to the persistance mechanism.
4. Where appropriate feel free to add any observations as comments.
